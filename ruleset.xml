 <!--
    Here we change two messages from the same sniff. Note how the
    codes are slightly different because the sniff developer has
    defined both a MaxExceeded message and a TooLong message. In the
    case of this sniff, one is used for warnings and one is used
    for errors.
 -->
 <rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength.MaxExceeded">
  <message>Line contains %s chars, which is longer than the max limit of %s</message>
 </rule>
 <rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength.TooLong">
  <message>Line longer than %s characters; contains %s characters</message>
 </rule>

 <!--
    Some sniffs have public member vars that allow you to
    customise specific elements of the sniff. In the case of
    the Generic LineLength sniff, you can customise the limit
    at which the sniff will throw warnings and the limit at
    which it will throw errors.

    The rule below includes the LineLength sniff but changes the
    settings so the sniff will show warnings for any line longer
    than 90 chars and errors for any line longer than 100 chars.
 -->
 <rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength">
  <properties>
   <property name="lineLimit" value="90"/>
   <property name="absoluteLineLimit" value="100"/>
  </properties>
 </rule>
